`0-reset_to_98.c` - Takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98\
`1-swap.c` - Swaps the values of two integers\
`2-strlen.c` - Returns the length of a string\
`3-puts.c` - Prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout\
`4-print_rev.c` -  Prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line\
`5-rev_string.c` -  Reverses a string\
`6-puts2.c` - Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line\
`7-puts_half.c` - Prints half of a string, followed by a new line. The function should print the second half of the string. If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2\
`8-print_array.c` - Prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed. Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space. The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array\
`9-strcpy.c` - Copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. Return value: the pointer to dest\
`100-atoi.c` - Convert a string to an integer. The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters. You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number. If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0. You are not allowed to use long. You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array. You are not allowed to hard-code special values. We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code\
`101-keygen.c` - Generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme. man srand, rand, time, gdb and objdump can help\
